Welcome to my blog! Feel free to look around and leave a comment.

This blog reviews a variety of Industrial and Organizational Psychology topics, most of them related to Hiring Decisions, Personnel Assessment, and Fairness, among others more important matters like Coffee, Traveling, and Music.

I started this blog as intent to refresh and review some topics that for different reasons arise my professional or personal interest. The timing to start this project is the result of a combination of unusual factors that gave me precious time to write, think and do something about hot-to-me topics.

Please share and leave your comments!
